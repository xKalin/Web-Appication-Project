The Bad The infotainment system lags when switching between menus and the car lacks device charging ports. The Bottom Line The 2019 Honda Civic is an even stronger compact sedan than before.</td>

A facelifted eighth-generation mid-size sedan is upon us now, and with seven models to choose from and an extensive list of options available, it's an almost guaranteed fit for any driver.</td>

        <td>The 2019 is the fifth Camry I have leased. The previous four were all reliable and great performers. I love the new styling of the 2019 Camry. The ride is also awesome. The problem with the car is very sluggish and delayed acceleration. My other four Camry's were very responsive and had quick acceleration, so much better than the 2019. I can't believe that the folks at Toyota aren't aware of this. I am very disappointed with the car's performance. Too bad, because it really is a nice car. Won't get a sixth one unless they fix this. Hoping for a software update or a recall to fix this very noticeable acceleration problem.</td>
